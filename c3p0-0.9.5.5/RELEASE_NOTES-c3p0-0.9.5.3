RELEASE NOTES, c3p0-0.9.5.3
===========================

+ This minor bugfix release addresses a security issue:

    CVE-2018-20433, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20433
    
  The c3p0 parsed XML config files liberally, including resolving external
  entity references. Incautious use of this feature could permit injection
  of malicious config. Now c3p0 does not resolve external entity references
  in its the XML config file.

  HOWEVER, in the EXCEEDINGLY RARE CASE that your configuration depends on
  the old behavior, if you have UNDERSTOOD the security concern, you may
  restore external entity resolution with the following config parameter
  (in c3p0.properties, as HOCON config, or as a System property):

     com.mchange.v2.c3p0.cfg.xml.expandEntityReferences=true

  Thanks to user zhutougg on GitHub for calling attention to and suggesting
  a fix for this issue.

+ c3p0 now supports logging to log4j2. (Logging to the old, original log4j
  library remains supported as well.) Thanks to user fireandfuel on GitHub
  for implementing this feature! (In the mchange-commons-java library.)
