RELEASE NOTES, c3p0-0.9.5.1
===========================

+ Full JDBC4 support.

+ Support for logging the SLF4J / logback library

+ Support for configuration via HOCON / typesafe-config files

+ Support for dynamic configuration reloading (to support autorestarting appservers like playframework)

+ Support for predictable, reproducible JMX names (whose uniqueness users must ensure!) via config parmeter
    com.mchange.v2.c3p0.management.ExcludeIdentityToken 

+ Configuration param 'forceUseNamedDriverClass' allows users to circumvent DriverManager resolution
  of JDBC-url appropriate Driver classes and use the class specified in the 'driverClass' config param
  unconditionally

+ Configuaration params 'privilegeSpawnedThreads' and 'contextClassLoaderSource' can be set to
  help avoid memory leaks following multiple hot redeploys (references to ClassLoaders from stale deployments)
  in some application servers (most prominently Tomcat).

+ Added support for easily deriving instrumented debug versions of ComboPooledDataSource, and implemented
  two of those:
     com.mchange.v2.c3p0.debug.AfterCloseLoggingComboPooledDataSource and
     com.mchange.v2.c3p0.debug.CloseLoggingComboPooledDataSource

+ Added support for a new configurataion parameter, forceSynchronousCheckins, which can offer significantly
  improved performance when no Connection tests are performed on check-in and no difficult work is performed
  in ConnectionCustomizer.onCheckIn(...)

+ Lots and lots of bug fixes, tweaks, etc.
